## Tendou for LightDM

A Windows 10 inspired theme for LightDM. [Try the demo](http://nejsan.github.io/lightdm-webkit-theme-tendou/) and see if you like it! This theme isn't intended to look exactly like Windows 10's login screen, but someone could make a fork of this that's more true to the original. I'll put a link to it here if someone actually does that.

This theme allows for switching users, but not graphical sessions. It also allows you to shutdown/restart/sleep from the menu in the bottom right.

### Roadmap
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for power actions
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for user switching
- [ ] Graphical session choice support
